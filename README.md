# Pressure sensor for COVID-19 ventilators
This repository contains all the necessary files for making an extremely low-cost pressure sensor design for ventilators. The sensor module is based on Bosch's BM280 pressure sensor. This sensor is commonly used in our smartphones and should be readily available within a market. Information for other sensors will be added soon.

The project is work-in-progress and the following objectives are expected to be achieved by Apr 5th, 2020.

1) Design concept: *done*
2) Part availability and stock info: *done* (see section below)
3) Datasheets and Technical inforL *done*
3) Circuit diagram and PCB files: *pending*
4) CAD files for 3D printing: *pending*
5) Assembly instructions: *pending*
5) dFMEA risk analysis for use in medical devices: *pending*

Stock availability of the sensor:
As of now, there are are
